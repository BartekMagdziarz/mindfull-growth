Big picture summary for V1:

1. Core concept

A personal, local-first mindful growth app with five main views:
	•	Today – a “hub” you’ll design later.
	•	Journal – deeper reflections (freeform + guided + periodic).
	•	Emotions – ultra-fast emotional check-ins.
	•	Exercises – structured self-reflection tools from different therapeutic schools.
	•	Profile – browsing all your data, filling in questionnaires, and (later) an AI-built psychological profile and insight chat.

Everything is built around a shared emotion system: a 2×2 grid (pleasantness × energy) with many emotions, reusable across the whole app.

⸻

2. Core data model (high-level)

You’re basically managing a few clean object types:
	Emotion
	•	From the shared “emotion database”.
	•	Has: id, name, pleasantness, energy

	JournalEntry
	•	Freeform text (or guided/periodic in future).
	•	Many emotions from the shared database.
	•	Optional tags: people, context/behaviors, etc.

	EmotionLog
	•	“Right now I feel…” snapshots.
	•	Many emotions from the shared database.
	•	Optional short note & tags.

	ExerciseSession
	•	A run of a specific exercise (CBT sheet, IFS exploration, etc.).
	•	Structured answers, optionally with emotion tags.

	QuestionnaireResult
	•	Results of longer questionnaires (Big Five, VIA, etc.).
	•	Stored in a structured way for later AI/profile work.

⸻

3. Emotion system & selector

3.1. Emotion database

Before you build journaling or emotion logging, you define a simple emotion database:
	•	Each emotion has coordinates on the pleasantness/energy grid.
	•	You can reuse the same list:
	•	In Journal for tagging entries.
	•	In Emotions for quick logs.
	•	In Exercises & Profile later.

This gives you a consistent emotional language across the app.

3.2. Emotion picking UI (shared component)
	•	First step: quadrant selector
	•	User picks one of four quadrants:
	•	High energy / high pleasantness
	•	High energy / low pleasantness
	•	Low energy / high pleasantness
	•	Low energy / low pleasantness
	•	Then shows emotions in that quadrant as selectable chips/grid.
	•	User can select many emotions for one entry/log.

This shared component is used in:
	•	Journal freeform entry.
	•	Emotion logging.
	•	(Later) Exercises & questionnaires.

4. Main views

4.1. Journal view

Purpose: A dedicated space for deeper written reflection.

Entry point: One of the main tabs.

Top-level UI:
Three big buttons at the top:
	1.	Free form entry (first to implement)
	•	Opens a clean editor:
	•	Title (optional).
	•	Body text.
	•	Date/time auto.
	•	Tags:
	•	Emotions via the shared emotion selector.
	•	People.
	•	Context / behaviors.
	•	On save: creates a JournalEntry.
	2.	Guided entry (later)
	•	Starts a step-based or AI-guided flow:
	•	App asks questions.
	•	Answers are saved and combined into one JournalEntry.
	3.	Periodic entry (later)
	•	Lets you choose a time range (week, month, custom).
	•	Shows entries for that range.
	•	Guides you into writing a summary JournalEntry about that period.

Below the buttons:
A list or timeline of journal entries only, with simple filters (by date, emotions, tags).
Global browsing of all objects lives in the Profile tab.

Problems this view solves:
	•	“I want one tap to start writing.”
	•	“I want richer, reflective writing separated from quick emotion logs.”
	•	“I want to tag entries with nuanced emotions, not just 1–2 generic ones.”

⸻

4.2. Emotions view

Purpose: Very fast emotional check-ins, ready to be extended to Apple Watch later.

Entry point: Own main tab.

Core v1 flow (kept intentionally minimal):
	•	Big button: “Log emotion”.
	•	On tap:
	•	Quadrant selector → list of emotions for that quadrant.
	•	User can choose many emotions.
	•	Optional short note field.
	•	Optional people/context tags (if you want them from day one).
	•	Save → creates an EmotionLog.

Problems this view solves:
	•	“I need to quickly capture how I feel, many times per day, without writing a full entry.”
	•	“I don’t want to be limited to only one or two emotions.”

⸻

4.3. Exercises view

Purpose: A library of therapeutic tools you can actually use, not just read about.

Entry point: Own main tab.

Early version:
	•	A small set of exercises to start (e.g., 2–4):
	•	CBT thought record.
	•	A simple values clarification.
	•	An IFS “meet a part” style exercise.
	•	Each exercise card shows:
	•	Name, origin school (CBT, IFS, etc.).
	•	Short description.
	•	Approximate time.

When you open an exercise:
	•	See the description and “Start exercise”.
	•	Run through a step-based flow.
	•	On completion:
	•	A new ExerciseSession is stored with your answers.
	•	You can optionally tag the final state with emotions (using the shared selector) if you want.

Over time you just keep adding new exercises; the data structure doesn’t need to change much.

Problems this view solves:
	•	“I constantly discover good exercises but forget or don’t have a place to run them.”
	•	“I want to revisit the same exercise over months to see how I change.”

⸻

4.4. Profile view

Purpose: The “thinking and overview” space: all your data in one place, plus questionnaires and, later, AI-powered profile and insights.

Entry point: Own main tab.

Stage 1 – Browsing view

Initially, the Profile tab is primarily a powerful browser:
	•	A unified list or explorer where you can see:
	•	Journal entries.
	•	Emotion logs.
	•	Exercise sessions.
	•	Questionnaire results (when they exist).
	•	Rich filters:
	•	By object type.
	•	By date ranges.
	•	By emotions (using the grid).
	•	By tags like people or context.

This is the “I want to see everything related to X emotion / person / period” view.

Stage 2 – Questionnaires and forms

You add:
	•	A “Questionnaires” section / button in Profile:
	•	Big Five.
	•	VIA Character Strengths.
	•	Other forms you find useful.
	•	Each questionnaire:
	•	Has its own flow and instructions.
	•	On completion, saves a QuestionnaireResult.

Stage 3 – Profile & AI interaction

Later, you add more “brains” in this tab:
	1.	Update Profile button
	•	Opens a view where you choose:
	•	Which object types (journal entries, emotion logs, exercises, questionnaires).
	•	Which time ranges.
	•	This tells the AI what to consider when (re)building your psychological profile.
	•	It doesn’t run constantly; you decide when to update.
	2.	Profile representation
	•	A readable summary of:
	•	Emotional patterns.
	•	Themes.
	•	Questionnaire-based traits/strengths.
	•	Built by AI from the chosen data.
	3.	Insights & filters as a chat-like view
	•	A conversational interface where you:
	•	Ask about patterns (“When do I tend to feel most drained?”).
	•	Explore correlations.
	•	Request suggestions for exercises or reflections.
	•	Under the hood it can use the same data and filters you already have; the UX is just more interactive.

Problems this view solves:
	•	“I want one place where I can see and filter EVERYTHING I’ve logged.”
	•	“I want to deepen my understanding via questionnaires.”
	•	“I want, eventually, a coherent psychological profile instead of scattered notes.”

⸻

4.5. Today view (future)

Purpose: A daily hub for quick actions and gentle guidance.

Developed after the other views exist, it might show things like:
	•	“New journal entry” / “Log emotion” shortcuts.
	•	A small highlight from your recent data.
	•	Suggested exercise or reflection.

For now it’s just a placeholder in the plan.

⸻

5. Suggested implementation order (beginner-friendly)

High level, phased in a way that should be manageable for a new dev:
	1.	Foundation
	•	Basic project structure.
	•	Simple Emotion database (list of emotions with quadrant coords).
	•	Shared emotion selector UI (quadrant → emotion list, multi-select).
	2.	Journal – Freeform only
	•	Journal tab with three buttons (only Free form active).
	•	Create/read/update/delete JournalEntry.
	•	Tag entries with multiple emotions + simple tags.
	3.	Emotions view – logging only
	•	Simple Emotion tab.
	•	Log flow → saves EmotionLog using the same emotion selector.
	•	Basic timeline list.
	4.	Profile – browsing view
	•	Profile tab showing all objects (JournalEntry + EmotionLog).
	•	Filters by type, date, emotions.
	5.	Exercises
	•	Exercises tab.
	•	A few static exercises.
	•	Store ExerciseSession and show them in Profile browsing.
	6.	Profile – questionnaires & later AI
	•	Add questionnaires.
	•	Later: “Update Profile”, AI-generated profile, and interactive insight chat.
