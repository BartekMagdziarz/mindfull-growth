Story 12 – Comprehensive Testing

Goal

Add comprehensive automated tests to ensure the entire emotion system, tagging, and emotion logging features work correctly together. This story focuses on integration tests for complete user flows, edge case testing, component interaction tests, database migration edge cases, and cross-view consistency verification. While individual stories (1-11) included minimal unit tests, Story 12 provides comprehensive coverage including end-to-end flows, error scenarios, and integration between components, stores, and views.

⸻

Inconsistencies & Notes

1.	Story Dependencies:
	•	Story 12 depends on all previous stories (1-11) being completed
	•	All features must be implemented before comprehensive testing can be done
	•	Story 12 verifies that all stories work together correctly
	•	No inconsistency – Story 12 is the final story in the epic

2.	Test Structure:
	•	Story 12 creates new test files in src/__tests__/integration/, src/__tests__/edge-cases/, src/__tests__/performance/
	•	This is a new directory structure for integration and edge case tests
	•	Unit tests remain in their existing locations (__tests__ folders next to components/stores)
	•	E2E tests remain in e2e/ directory
	•	No inconsistency – new test types require new directory structure

3.	Test Coverage Targets:
	•	Story 12 targets > 80% coverage for all files, > 90% for critical paths
	•	This is a reasonable target for comprehensive testing
	•	Some areas may have lower coverage due to difficulty testing (e.g., IndexedDB errors)
	•	No inconsistency – coverage targets are achievable and reasonable

4.	Performance Test Expectations:
	•	Story 12 verifies performance but doesn't optimize
	•	If performance issues are found, they are documented but not necessarily fixed
	•	This is appropriate – performance optimization can be a separate story
	•	No inconsistency – performance testing and optimization are separate concerns

5.	E2E Test Structure:
	•	Story 12 adds E2E tests for emotion log flow
	•	E2E tests follow the same pattern as existing journal-flow.spec.ts
	•	E2E tests use Playwright (same as existing tests)
	•	No inconsistency – E2E test structure is consistent

6.	Integration Test Scope:
	•	Story 12 focuses on integration tests that verify complete flows
	•	Integration tests use real stores and repositories (not mocks)
	•	This is different from unit tests which use mocks
	•	No inconsistency – integration tests should use real implementations

7.	Edge Case Test Scope:
	•	Story 12 tests edge cases that may not be covered in unit tests
	•	Edge cases include error scenarios, empty states, data integrity issues
	•	These tests complement unit tests by testing scenarios that are hard to test in isolation
	•	No inconsistency – edge case tests fill gaps in unit test coverage

8.	Component Interaction Test Scope:
	•	Story 12 tests how components interact with each other
	•	These tests verify that components work correctly when used together
	•	This is different from unit tests which test components in isolation
	•	No inconsistency – component interaction tests verify integration between components

9.	Database Migration Test Scope:
	•	Story 12 tests migration edge cases that may not be covered in migration.spec.ts
	•	Migration edge cases include error scenarios, large datasets, idempotency
	•	These tests complement existing migration tests
	•	No inconsistency – migration edge case tests fill gaps in migration test coverage

10.	Cross-View Consistency Test Scope:
	•	Story 12 verifies that tags and emotions appear consistently across views
	•	This ensures a consistent user experience
	•	These tests verify that the same data is displayed the same way in different views
	•	No inconsistency – cross-view consistency is important for user experience

11.	Test File Organization:
	•	Story 12 creates test files in multiple directories:
		•	src/__tests__/integration/ – integration tests
		•	src/__tests__/edge-cases/ – edge case tests
		•	src/__tests__/performance/ – performance tests
		•	e2e/ – E2E tests (existing directory)
	•	This organization makes it easy to find and run specific test types
	•	No inconsistency – test organization is logical and maintainable

12.	Test Data Management:
	•	Story 12 tests use test data that is created and cleaned up in tests
	•	Integration tests may use real IndexedDB (with cleanup)
	•	E2E tests use real IndexedDB (with cleanup in beforeEach)
	•	No inconsistency – test data management is consistent with existing patterns

13.	Test Patterns:
	•	Story 12 follows existing test patterns:
		•	Unit tests use Vitest (same as existing tests)
		•	E2E tests use Playwright (same as existing tests)
		•	Test structure follows existing conventions
	•	No inconsistency – test patterns are consistent

14.	Story 11 Consistency Check:
	•	Story 11 (just implemented) created EmotionLogEditorView with unit tests
	•	Story 12 adds integration tests that verify EmotionLogEditorView works with stores and repositories
	•	Story 12 adds E2E tests that verify EmotionLogEditorView works in complete user flows
	•	No inconsistencies detected that would require backtracking from Story 11
	•	Story 12 complements Story 11's unit tests with integration and E2E tests

15.	Story 10 Consistency Check:
	•	Story 10 (recently implemented) created EmotionsView with unit tests
	•	Story 12 adds integration tests that verify EmotionsView works with stores
	•	Story 12 adds cross-view consistency tests that verify EmotionsView displays tags consistently
	•	No inconsistencies detected that would require backtracking from Story 10
	•	Story 12 complements Story 10's unit tests with integration and consistency tests

16.	Story 9 Consistency Check:
	•	Story 9 (recently implemented) created useEmotionLogStore with unit tests
	•	Story 12 adds integration tests that verify useEmotionLogStore works with repositories
	•	Story 12 adds edge case tests that verify useEmotionLogStore handles errors correctly
	•	No inconsistencies detected that would require backtracking from Story 9
	•	Story 12 complements Story 9's unit tests with integration and edge case tests

17.	Epic Completion:
	•	Story 12 completes Epic 2 by providing comprehensive test coverage
	•	After Story 12, Epic 2 is complete and all features are tested
	•	No inconsistency – Story 12 is the final story in the epic

18.	Test Maintenance:
	•	Story 12 creates tests that need to be maintained as features evolve
	•	Tests should be updated when features change
	•	Test documentation helps maintain tests
	•	No inconsistency – test maintenance is a normal part of development

19.	Test Execution Time:
	•	Story 12 adds many tests, which may increase test execution time
	•	Integration tests and E2E tests are slower than unit tests
	•	This is expected and acceptable – comprehensive testing takes time
	•	No inconsistency – test execution time is a trade-off for comprehensive coverage

20.	Future Test Improvements:
	•	Story 12 provides comprehensive test coverage, but there's always room for improvement
		•	More edge cases could be tested
		•	More performance scenarios could be tested
		•	More E2E scenarios could be tested
	•	These improvements can be done incrementally in future stories
	•	No inconsistency – Story 12 provides a solid foundation for future test improvements

21.	Epic Description Note on Unit Tests:
	•	The epic description (section 12) lists many unit tests for stores and components
	•	However, the epic notes section states: "Each story should include minimal unit tests. Story 12 focuses on comprehensive and integration testing."
	•	This means:
		•	Unit tests for stores and components should have been implemented in Stories 1-11 (and they were)
		•	Story 12 focuses on integration tests, edge cases, E2E tests, and comprehensive testing beyond unit tests
	•	If any unit tests from the epic description are missing, they should be added to the appropriate story (1-11), not Story 12
	•	Story 12 assumes unit tests are already in place and focuses on higher-level testing
	•	No inconsistency – Story 12 correctly focuses on comprehensive and integration testing as specified in the epic notes

22.	Test Coverage Verification:
	•	Story 12 verifies that unit tests from Stories 1-11 are in place and passing
	•	Story 12 adds integration tests that verify components and stores work together
	•	Story 12 adds E2E tests that verify complete user flows
	•	Story 12 adds edge case tests that verify error handling and edge cases
	•	If unit tests are missing from Stories 1-11, they should be added before Story 12
	•	No inconsistency – Story 12 builds on the foundation of unit tests from previous stories
