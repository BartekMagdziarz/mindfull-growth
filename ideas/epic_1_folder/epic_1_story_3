Story 3 – Journal View with Three Large Action Cards

Goal

Implement the Journal view as the main entry point for journaling, featuring three prominent Material Design–inspired action cards/buttons that represent the different journaling modes. This story establishes the visual foundation and navigation structure for the journaling feature.

⸻

Scope

	1.	Journal View Layout
	•	Route: /journal → JournalView.vue (already exists from Story 1, but needs to be updated).
	•	Top app bar:
	•	Display title "Journal".
	•	Use AppTopAppBar component (already implemented in Story 1).
	•	Main content area:
	•	Center the three primary action cards/buttons vertically on the screen.
	•	Apply generous whitespace using Material Design spacing tokens (approximated in Tailwind):
	•	Use spacing like mt-8, gap-6, px-4, etc. to achieve 24px/32px spacing where appropriate.
	•	Ensure cards are visually balanced and centered.

	2.	Three Primary Action Cards/Buttons
	•	Implement three large, Material Design–inspired cards or buttons:
	•	Free form (active):
	•	Icon: edit icon (e.g., pencil/edit icon).
	•	Title: "Free form".
	•	Description: Short descriptive text explaining freeform journaling (e.g., "Write freely about your thoughts and experiences").
	•	Guided (placeholder):
	•	Icon: lightbulb icon (or similar).
	•	Title: "Guided".
	•	Description: Short descriptive text (e.g., "Follow prompts and questions").
	•	Periodic (placeholder):
	•	Icon: calendar icon (or similar).
	•	Title: "Periodic".
	•	Description: Short descriptive text (e.g., "Scheduled reflection moments").
	•	Component choice:
	•	Use either <AppCard> or <AppButton> components (from Story 1) for each action.
	•	Ensure each card/button has:
	•	Rounded corners (Material Design style).
	•	Appropriate elevation or border.
	•	Hover and pressed states.
	•	Icon displayed prominently (top or left of title).
	•	Title text.
	•	Short description text below the title.
	•	Visual styling that makes them feel like primary actions (generous padding, clear hierarchy).

	3.	Navigation Behavior
	•	Free form card/button:
	•	On click: Navigate to /journal/new (new route to be created in a later story).
	•	For now, this route can be a placeholder or can be prepared but not fully implemented.
	•	Guided card/button:
	•	On click: Show a non-blocking snackbar/toast message: "Coming soon".
	•	Alternatively: Display a disabled state visually (grayed out, no interaction).
	•	Periodic card/button:
	•	On click: Show a non-blocking snackbar/toast message: "Coming soon".
	•	Alternatively: Display a disabled state visually (grayed out, no interaction).
	•	Note: Snackbar/toast implementation can be a simple temporary message overlay or a more sophisticated component. For this story, a simple implementation is acceptable.

	4.	Empty State Placeholder
	•	Below the three action cards:
	•	Display a placeholder message: "No entries yet".
	•	This will be replaced with an actual entries list in a future story.
	•	Style the empty state text appropriately (e.g., muted color, centered).

	5.	Material Design Spacing & Layout
	•	Apply Material Design spacing principles:
	•	Use Tailwind classes that approximate Material spacing tokens:
	•	24px spacing: gap-6, mt-6, mb-6, etc.
	•	32px spacing: gap-8, mt-8, mb-8, etc.
	•	16px spacing: gap-4, mt-4, mb-4, etc.
	•	Ensure cards have generous padding (e.g., p-6 or p-8).
	•	Maintain consistent spacing between elements.
	•	Keep the layout responsive and centered.

Acceptance Criteria

	•	JournalView.vue displays:
	•	A top app bar with the title "Journal".
	•	Three large, centered action cards/buttons:
	•	Free form (with edit icon, title, and description).
	•	Guided (with lightbulb icon, title, and description).
	•	Periodic (with calendar icon, title, and description).
	•	An empty state message "No entries yet" below the cards.
	•	Clicking Free form:
	•	Navigates to /journal/new (or shows appropriate navigation behavior).
	•	Clicking Guided or Periodic:
	•	Shows a "Coming soon" message (snackbar/toast) or displays a disabled state.
	•	Visual design:
	•	Cards/buttons follow Material Design principles (rounded corners, appropriate elevation/border, hover states).
	•	Layout uses generous whitespace and Material spacing tokens (24px/32px approximated in Tailwind).
	•	Icons, titles, and descriptions are clearly visible and well-organized.
	•	The view is visually centered and balanced.
	•	Linting and TypeScript checks pass (no new linting or type errors introduced).

Out of Scope

	•	Implementation of the /journal/new route and freeform editor (will be covered in a later story).
	•	Implementation of Guided and Periodic journaling flows.
	•	Display of actual journal entries list (will be added in a future story).
	•	Advanced snackbar/toast component (simple implementation is sufficient for this story).
	•	Any changes to the domain model, repository, or store (already implemented in Story 2).
